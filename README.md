# ðŸ©¸ Diabetes Risk Prediction Using AI Scoring Models

This project builds supervised machine learning models to generate **AI-based risk scores for diabetes** using clinical, behavioral, and demographic data. The system aims to provide interpretable predictions to support **early diagnosis**, **personalized intervention**, and **AI-driven digital health systems**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- To develop models that classify patients based on diabetes risk (Low, Medium, High).
- Generate interpretable AI scores for clinical or mobile health use.
- Build a pipeline that is deployable in real-world applications like health dashboards or telehealth platforms.

---

## ðŸ©º Healthcare Impact

Diabetes is a leading chronic illness affecting over 500 million people globally. Many cases go undiagnosed until complications occur. This project leverages **predictive analytics** to assist in early risk detection, reducing long-term complications and costs.
